# Step 1: Data Collection
# You can use libraries like TensorFlow Datasets or manually collect and preprocess your own dataset.

# Step 2: Data Preprocessing
# Preprocess images (resize, normalize, etc.) and split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.

# Step 3: Model Selection
# Choose a pre-trained CNN architecture like ResNet or Inception, or build your own custom CNN.

base_model = tf.keras.applications.ResNet50(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(224, 224, 3))
base_model.trainable = False

# Step 4: Model Training
# Fine-tune the selected model on your dataset, and include a regression component for calorie estimation.
model = models.Sequential([
    base_model,
    layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D(),
    layers.Dense(1024, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(1)  # Regression layer for calorie estimation
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=10, validation_data=(val_images, val_labels))

# Step 5: Evaluation
# Evaluate the model on the test set
test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(test_images, test_labels)

# Step 6: Deployment
# Deploy the model as a web or mobile application using frameworks like Flask or TensorFlow Serving.

# Step 7: Continuous Improvement
# Collect user feedback and update the model accordingly
